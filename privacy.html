        </div>

        <h2>COLLECTING AND USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        
        <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
        
        <h4>Personal Data</h4>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Noorly does NOT collect any personally identifiable information.</strong> We do not ask for, collect, store, or process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email address</li>

                <li>Any other personally identifiable information</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Usage Data</h4>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Noorly does NOT collect Usage Data.</strong> We do not collect:</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Noorly does NOT collect any information while you use the Application.</strong> We do not request or collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information regarding your location</li>

Progress tracking for Sunnah completion, theme preferences (light or dark mode), and onboarding status are stored locally using AsyncStorage, while basic app preferences remain on your device without external transmission. The app does not synchronize data to external servers or cloud services. You maintain complete control over this local data and can reset or delete all information by uninstalling the application.</p>

        <h2>THIRD-PARTY DATA SHARING - APPLE REQUIREMENT</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not share user data with any third parties because we do not collect any user data.</strong> This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No analytics tools process user data</li>
            <li>No advertising networks have access to user data</li>
            <li>No third-party SDKs collect or process user data</li>
            <li>No parent, subsidiary, or related entities have access to user data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As required by Apple guidelines, any third party that would have access to user data would provide the same protection as stated in this policy. Since we collect no data, this requirement is satisfied by design.</p>

        <h2>DATA RETENTION AND DELETION - APPLE REQUIREMENT</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Retention Policy:</strong> Since we do not collect any personal data, we have no data to retain on our servers.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> The only data associated with Noorly (local progress, theme preferences, and onboarding status) exists solely on your device and can be deleted by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstalling the Noorly app</li>
            <li>Using your device's app data clearing features</li>
            <li>Resetting your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Revoking Consent:</strong> Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no consent to revoke regarding data collection. You maintain complete control over any local data on your device.</p>

        <h2>USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p><strong>Since we do not collect any Personal Data, this section does not apply to Noorly.</strong> We cannot use, share, or process data that we do not collect.</p>

        <h2>TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p><strong>Since we do not collect any Personal Data, there are no data transfers.</strong> No information is transmitted from your device to our servers or any third-party services.</p>

        <h2>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        
        <h3>Business Transactions</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect Personal Data, there is no Personal Data that could be transferred in the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.</p>

        <h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect any Personal Data, we have no Personal Data to disclose to law enforcement or public authorities, even if required by law.</p>

        <h3>Other Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect Personal Data, we have no Personal Data to disclose for legal compliance, protection of rights, or any other legal requirements.</p>

        <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect any Personal Data, we have designed Noorly with security principles in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app operates without network connections for data collection</li>
            <li>Local data storage uses your device's built-in security measures</li>
            <li>No personal information is at risk since none is collected</li>
            <li>The app requests minimal device permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not use any Service Providers that process Personal Data since we do not collect any Personal Data.</strong></p>

            <h3>Navigation and UI Libraries</h3>

            <h4>React Navigation (@react-navigation/*)</h4>
            <p>The React Navigation library manages in-app navigation between screens and user interface transitions. The application uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>@react-navigation/native:</strong> Core navigation functionality</li>
                <li><strong>@react-navigation/stack:</strong> Stack-based screen navigation</li>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> No external data collection - navigation state local only</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> No data sharing - no external navigation or deep linking</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Navigation occurs entirely within the app</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>React Native Gesture Handler</h4>
            <p>Provides touch gesture recognition and handling for interactive UI elements. All gesture processing occurs locally on the device without any data collection or external transmission.</p>

            <h4>React Native Safe Area Context</h4>

                <li>Email integration uses device's native email app only</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Privacy Commitment:</strong> Future integration of third-party SDKs or services will require complete disclosure in privacy policy documentation with full transparency regarding data collection practices. We commit to maintaining our no-data-collection approach and will only use technologies that align with our privacy-by-design principles.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p><strong>We do NOT use any third-party analytics services.</strong> We do not use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Analytics</li>
            <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
            <li>Facebook Analytics</li>
            <li>Any other analytics or monitoring services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Email Marketing</h3>
        <p><strong>We do NOT engage in email marketing.</strong> We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect email addresses</li>
            <li>Send newsletters or promotional materials</li>
            <li>Use any email marketing services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Feedback System</h3>
        <p>The application's feedback functionality operates through integration with the user's device native email application, automatically launching the default email client such as Gmail or Mail when feedback submission is initiated. Users compose and transmit feedback messages using their personal email applications, with all communication occurring through standard email correspondence rather than direct data collection by the Noorly application. The feedback process represents normal email communication between users and developers, maintaining complete user control over message content and transmission timing.</p>

        <h2>TRACKING AND ADVERTISING - APPLE ATT COMPLIANCE</h2>
        <p>Noorly maintains strict compliance with Apple's App Tracking Transparency requirements through complete elimination of cross-app and cross-website user tracking mechanisms. The application architecture specifically excludes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linking user data from Noorly with information from other applications or websites</li>
            <li>Accessing device advertising identifiers including IDFA</li>
            <li>Sharing data with advertising networks or data brokers</li>
            <li>Implementing App Tracking Transparency framework components since no tracking activities occur within the application environment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The system operates without targeted advertising capabilities or advertising measurement functionalities, ensuring complete user privacy protection through comprehensive tracking prevention measures.</p>

        <h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
        <p><strong>Age Requirements and Parental Consent:</strong> This Application is intended for users who are thirteen (13) years of age or older. Users under the age of thirteen (13) may only access and use this Application with the express written consent of a parent or legal guardian and under their direct, ongoing supervision.</p>
        
        <p>Given that our Application does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information from users of any age, including children under thirteen (13), there are no heightened privacy risks associated with supervised use by minors. However, parental oversight remains required for users under thirteen (13) to ensure appropriate usage and compliance with applicable children's privacy regulations.</p>

        <p>Parents and legal guardians may permit supervised use of this Application with confidence, understanding that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No personal information is collected from any user, regardless of age</li>
            <li>No user account registration or personal data submission is required</li>
            <li>All data processing occurs locally on the user's device without external transmission</li>
            <li>All educational content has been curated to be appropriate for users of all ages</li>
            <li>Parental supervision ensures compliance with our age requirements and appropriate usage patterns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Compliance:</strong> This Application complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and applicable children's privacy regulations by implementing a privacy-by-design approach that eliminates the collection of personal information from users of any age. For users under thirteen (13) years of age, express parental consent and ongoing supervision are mandatory prerequisites for access to and use of this Application.</p>

        <h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>

        <h3>EXTERNAL LINKS AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT</h3>
        <p><strong>Controlled Content Hosting:</strong> This Application includes hyperlinks to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which are hosted on GitHub Pages under our direct ownership and control. These linked documents contain identical content to that presented within the Application and are provided to enhance user accessibility and convenience in reviewing our legal documentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Email Communication Protocol:</strong> The Application facilitates user-initiated contact through a mailto: protocol implementation that interfaces with the user's native email client application. This functionality does not constitute external website linking and does not involve data transmission to third-party servers by our Application. When users elect to send feedback via email, any data collection or processing is governed entirely by the user's designated email service provider (such as Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, or other email services). We, as the Application developer, do not collect, store, or process any personal information through this email mechanism. The user's email service provider may collect and process email communications according to their own privacy policies, over which we have no control or influence.</p>

        <p><strong>Email Service Provider Data Practices:</strong> We do not have access to, control over, or responsibility for the data collection practices of email service providers such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook, or other email platforms that users may employ to contact us. Users should consult their email service provider's privacy policy to understand how their email communications are handled, stored, and processed by those third-party services.</p>

        <p><strong>Third-Party Content Disclaimer:</strong> This Application does not incorporate links to third-party websites, external services, or content repositories outside of our direct administrative control. We maintain comprehensive editorial and technical responsibility for all content hosted on our GitHub Pages infrastructure.</p>

        <p><strong>Contact for Link-Related Inquiries:</strong> Users requiring clarification regarding any hyperlinks or external references within this Application may direct their inquiries to noorlyappfeedback@gmail.com for prompt resolution and assistance.</p>

        <h2>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
        <p>Since Noorly does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, there are no international data transfers. All app functionality occurs locally on your device regardless of your geographic location.</p>

        <h2>YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>While various international and domestic privacy regulations confer specific rights upon individuals regarding the collection, processing, and handling of their personal data, such rights are not applicable to this Application given our fundamental design principle of not collecting any personal data whatsoever. Notwithstanding the inapplicability of traditional data subject rights, users retain comprehensive autonomy and control over any locally stored information through several mechanisms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users may access and review their progress tracking, theme settings, and onboarding status directly within the Application interface</li>
            <li>Complete data deletion may be accomplished through standard application uninstallation procedures, which removes all locally stored information from the device</li>
            <li>Individual progress entries may be modified or deleted through the Application's interface on a per-item basis</li>
            <li>Theme preferences may be adjusted at the user's discretion</li>
            <li>Data portability concerns are inherently satisfied as all information exists exclusively on the user's device under their direct control without external synchronization or cloud storage dependencies</li>
            <li>Users maintain complete discretion over their local data environment without requiring external intervention or data processing by our organization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post the new Privacy Policy on this page</li>
            <li>Update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy</li>
            <li>Follow Apple's requirements for notifying users of privacy policy changes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed of any updates. Continued use of the app after changes have been posted will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (GDPR COMPLIANCE)</h2>
        <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy laws, this section would typically explain the legal basis for processing personal data. Since Noorly does not process any personal data, no legal basis is required. This privacy-by-design approach ensures compliance with global privacy regulations.</p>
